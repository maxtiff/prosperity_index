1. fip_id.xlsx

the "Base" sheet of this dataset contains the names of the 3,143 census counties (from 2010) along with their respective ID. I use this file at the end to
complete the final merge of the small business ownership rate across the various years (and files) into one final dataset.

2. cbpyyco.txt

This is the county business patterns data from the census. We are only using years 2009-2014 because that is the data that is available for the labor force participation
from the ACS 5 year estimates.
